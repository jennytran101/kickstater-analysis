# kickstater-analysis
week 1 challenge
## Overview of Project
This project is help Louise to get fund for her rise. The budget that she estimated is $10,000 and this is the first time she does fundraising. She decided to use Excel to help Louise find the best way for her campaign to get success. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this Project is help Louise’s play to compare with other campaign about goas, budget, duration, outcome, etc before the fundraising goal happen. So that, she can have more specific strategy to prepare for her play before the fundraising.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the Outcomes based on Goals, we can see theater got successful decrease through the year. The highest year that theater got successful is May and the lowest successful is in December. Percentage of failed in movie is increasing and get highest failed percentage in October. Live is increasing but got stop in March. Canceled is increasing but it stopped increasing in September then continue to increase in November. If the failed percentage keeps increasing and successful percentage keeps decreasing, they will meet in a point around 38 or 39.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Based on the Outcomes Based on Goals the Percentage of successful is decreased (about 50%), the percentage of failed is increased (about 35%) and the percentage of canceled is increased (about 18%). The percentage of successful and failed will meet at 3 points (15000 to 19999, 45%), (the point between 30000 to 34999 and 35000 to 39999, 44%), (the point between 40000 to 49999 and 45000 to 49999, 42%). And the percentage of canceled will meet the percentage of successful at the point (greater than 50000, 22%). Overall, we can see that the percentage of successful have the biggest change because it decreased from 70% to lower than20% and it decreased about 50%. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges and difficulties can be encountered when the pledged amount received for “Fever” play is less than the amount she had contemplated. That will lead to losses in the production of the play. Therefore, all calculations by using Excel tables must be very detailed and careful to avoid possible worst cases.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    In order to get most successful, Louise’s play should be do a fundraising in May. In May, the percentage of failed is increased but it won’t affect much if we compare with the percentage of successful. 
    Louise should not do the campaign in December because based on the graph, successful and failed will at a point in December. This will take risk for her campaign since the chance of failed might be higher than the chance of successful.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    At the beginning, Louise’s budget is over $10,000, based on the graph if she wants to get over $10,000 budget, she might get 52% of successful and 40% of failed. Overall, she might get success in the campaign. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limits of this datasheet are there are too much data and sometimes it gets difficult to load the data as well as when I copy the sheet, it is hard to paste enough data into the new sheet.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create graph about parent category and graph about the parent category based on the country.
